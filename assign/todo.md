# COSC3500 Assignment TODO

## Performance targets

`ratio = our runtime / reference runtime`; lower is better.

| Implementation | Hardware | Reference | Target ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| CPU | 4 CPU cores | MKL | `<= 1.10x` |
| GPU | 1 CUDA GPU | CUBLAS | `<= 2.00x` |
| MPI | 2 nodes, 4 CPU cores each | MKL | `<= 1.00x` |

## CPU - `matrixMultiply.cpp`

- [x] Implement a plain triple-loop matrix multiply as the correctness baseline.
- [x] Run the CPU debug job at `N=128`; confirm the result is correct.
- [x] Record the baseline runtime ratio before changing anything.
- [x] Improve loop order and cache locality; benchmark again.
- [ ] Add cache blocking; benchmark again.
- [ ] Add AVX SIMD; benchmark again.
- [ ] Add OpenMP across independent output rows using four cores.
- [ ] Reach `<= 1.10x` MKL at `N=2048`.

## GPU - `matrixMultiplyGPU.cu`

- [ ] Write a naive CUDA kernel with one thread per output element.
- [ ] Allocate device memory and copy `A` and `B` to the GPU.
- [ ] Launch the kernel, wait for it to finish, and copy `C` back.
- [ ] Handle matrix sizes that are not exact multiples of the block dimensions.
- [ ] Run the GPU debug job at `N=2048`; confirm correctness and record the baseline ratio.
- [ ] Add shared-memory tiling and coalesced memory access.
- [ ] Tune block dimensions using benchmark results.
- [ ] Reach `<= 2.00x` CUBLAS at `N=2048`.

## MPI - `matrixMultiplyMPI.cpp`

- [ ] Split contiguous output rows between MPI ranks.
- [ ] Compute each rank's rows with the fastest CPU kernel using four cores.
- [ ] Gather the rows so every rank ends with a complete copy of `C`.
- [ ] Handle row counts that do not divide evenly between ranks.
- [ ] Run the MPI debug job with two ranks at `N=128`; confirm correctness.
- [ ] Record compute and communication time separately.
- [ ] Reach `<= 1.00x` MKL at `N=2048` using two nodes and four cores per node.

## Final checks

- [ ] Keep `N <= 0` safe and return the student ID from every implementation.
- [ ] Benchmark one change at a time and keep only measured improvements.
- [ ] Run the CPU, GPU, and MPI debug jobs separately before Judgement Day.
- [ ] Run the final `N=2048` Judgement Day job and save every Slurm output file.
- [ ] Submit `matrixMultiply.cpp`, `matrixMultiplyGPU.cu`, `matrixMultiplyMPI.cpp`, and `slurm.zip` inside `49088276.zip`.
